## Key Features of BLAKE2

- **Efficiency**: Faster than MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 while maintaining robust security.
- **Customizability**: Supports keyed hashing, optional salt, personalization, and tree hashing.
- **Versatile Output Sizes**: Can produce hashes of any size from 1 to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b and up to 32 bytes for BLAKE2s.
- **Two Variants**:
  - **BLAKE2b**: Optimized for 64-bit platforms.
  - **BLAKE2s**: Optimized for 32-bit platforms and resource-constrained environments.
