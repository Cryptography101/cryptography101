# Upgrade Strategies
## Hash Algorithm Migration

### Planning
- Assess current system security
- Choose new hash algorithm
- Develop migration strategy
- Test migration process

### Implementation
1. Add new algorithm support
2. Gradually rehash existing values
3. Update verification logic
4. Remove old algorithm support

### Code Example
```python
def verify_and_upgrade_hash(stored_hash, password, old_algo, new_algo):
    if verify_hash(stored_hash, password, old_algo):
        new_hash = generate_hash(password, new_algo)
        update_stored_hash(new_hash)
        return True
    return False
```

### Migration Monitoring
- Track migration progress
- Monitor system performance
- Handle migration failures
- Document changes

## Security Considerations

### During Migration
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log security events
- Monitor for attacks

### Post-Migration
- Verify complete migration
- Update documentation
- Remove old algorithm support
- Security audit
