# Welcome to Cryptography101

Hey there! Ready to dive into the world of cryptography? Whether you're gearing up for CTF challenges, building secure systems, or just curious about how encryption works, you're in the right place.

## What's Different About This Guide?

Let's be real - most crypto resources either drown you in math or just tell you to "use this library." We're taking a different approach. Here, you'll:
- Learn the concepts by actually doing stuff
- See how things work under the hood
- Get your hands dirty with real code
- Tackle practical challenges

## What You'll Learn

### The Basics
- A crash course in the math you actually need
- How modern cryptography really works
- Common patterns and pitfalls to avoid

### The Cool Stuff
- Building and breaking crypto systems
- Solving CTF challenges
- Writing secure code
- Using crypto tools like a pro

### The Cutting Edge
- Post-quantum crypto
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Hardware security
- And more as the field evolves

## Who Is This For?

- CTF players looking to level up their crypto game
- Developers who want to build secure systems
- Security folks diving deeper into crypto
- Anyone curious about how encryption works

## How to Use This Guide

### New to Crypto?
Start with the history section - trust us, it helps! Then move on to the math basics. Don't worry, we'll keep it relevant and interesting.

### Some Experience?
Jump straight to the topics you need. Each section stands on its own, but we'll point you to any prerequisites you might need.

### Advanced User?
Check out our deep dives into modern crypto and contribute your knowledge. The field is always evolving, and we're learning together.
