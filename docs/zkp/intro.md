# Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

Zero-knowledge proofs represent one of cryptography's most elegant and powerful concepts: proving you know something without revealing what you know. From privacy-preserving blockchain transactions to anonymous credentials, ZKPs are reshaping digital trust.

## Core Concepts

### What is a Zero-Knowledge Proof?

A zero-knowledge proof is a method where a prover convinces a verifier that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement. For example, proving you're over 18 without revealing your actual age.

### Properties of ZKP

Every zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three fundamental properties:

**Completeness**  
If the statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover.

**Soundness**  
If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier that it's true, except with negligible probability.

**Zero-Knowledge**  
If the statement is true, the verifier learns nothing other than the fact that the statement is true.

## Types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### Interactive vs Non-Interactive

#### Interactive ZKP
- Requires multiple rounds of communication between prover and verifier
- Examples: Feige-Fiat-Shamir protocol, Zero-Knowledge Password Proof
- Use cases: Authentication systems, secure multiparty computation

#### Non-Interactive ZKP (NIZK)
- Requires only one message from prover to verifier
- Created using Fiat-Shamir heuristic or common reference strings
- Examples: zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs
- Use cases: Blockchain privacy, anonymous credentials

## Modern ZKP Systems

### zk-SNARKs
*Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge*

- Extremely compact proofs
- Constant verification time
- Requires trusted setup
- Used in: Zcash, Ethereum privacy solutions

### zk-STARKs
*Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge*

- Post-quantum secure
- No trusted setup required
- Larger proof size than SNARKs
- Used in: StarkNet, privacy-preserving computation

### Bulletproofs
- Optimized for range proofs
- No trusted setup
- Logarithmic proof size
- Used in: Monero, confidential transactions

    # This is a classic ZKP example
    pass
```

### Range Proof Example
```python
def prove_range(value, range_start, range_end):
    # Example implementation of a range proof
    # Shows value is within [range_start, range_end]
    pass
```
