# Mathematics for Cryptography

## Introduction
Mathematics forms the backbone of modern cryptography. This guide covers the essential mathematical concepts you need to understand cryptographic systems and algorithms.

## Number Theory Fundamentals

### Prime Numbers
Prime numbers are the building blocks of modern cryptography. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Key concepts:
- Prime factorization
- The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
- Testing for primality
- Large prime numbers in cryptography

### Modular Arithmetic
Modular arithmetic is essential for many cryptographic operations, especially in public-key cryptography.

#### Basic Operations
- Addition modulo n: (a + b) mod n
- Multiplication modulo n: (a × b) mod n
- Exponentiation modulo n: (a^b) mod n

#### Properties
- Commutative property: (a + b) mod n = (b + a) mod n
- Associative property: ((a + b) + c) mod n = (a + (b + c)) mod n
- Distributive property: (a × (b + c)) mod n = ((a × b) + (a × c)) mod n

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
The GCD is crucial for key generation and determining multiplicative inverses.

- Euclidean algorithm
- Extended Euclidean algorithm
- Bézout's identity

## Algebraic Structures

### Groups
Groups are fundamental to public-key cryptography.

Properties:
- Closure
- Associativity
- Identity element
- Inverse elements

Important examples:
- Multiplicative group of integers modulo n
- Elliptic curve groups

### Fields
Fields provide the mathematical foundation for many cryptographic operations.

Types:
- Finite fields (Galois fields)
- Binary fields GF(2^n)
- Prime fields GF(p)

## Number Theory for Public-Key Cryptography

### Euler's Totient Function
φ(n) counts the numbers less than n that are coprime to n.

Properties:
- For prime p: φ(p) = p - 1
- For prime p, q: φ(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)

### Fermat's Little Theorem
For prime p and integer a not divisible by p:
a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)

### Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
Used for efficient implementations of RSA and other cryptographic algorithms.

## Probability and Information Theory

### Entropy
Measuring randomness and information content:
- Shannon entropy
- Min-entropy
- Perfect secrecy

### Random Number Generation
- True random numbers vs. pseudo-random numbers
- Statistical tests for randomness
- Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNG)

## Advanced Topics

### Elliptic Curve Mathematics
- Point addition and multiplication
- Discrete logarithm problem
- Bilinear pairings

### Lattice-Based Cryptography
- Lattice definitions and properties
- Hard lattice problems
- Learning With Errors (LWE)

## Computational Complexity

### Big O Notation
Understanding algorithmic efficiency:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Common complexity classes
