## Islamic Golden Age

Arab scholars made significant advances in cryptography:
- Al-Kindi wrote the "Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages," introducing frequency analysis
- Development of the monoalphabetic substitution cipher
- Ibn al-Durayhim's comprehensive work on cryptographic systems and their weaknesses

## European Developments

- Monasteries became centers for cryptographic innovation, developing sophisticated codes for protecting religious texts
- The rise of diplomatic missions led to increased use of ciphers in political communication
- Creation of nomenclators, combining substitution ciphers with code words for common phrases

## Far Eastern Contributions
