# Cryptography in the World Wars (1914-1945)

## The Era That Changed Everything

The World Wars marked a pivotal transformation in cryptography, where codes and ciphers directly influenced the outcome of global conflicts. This period witnessed the evolution of cryptography from a manual art to a mechanized science, forever changing how we approach secure communications.

## World War I (1914-1918)

### Room 40: Britain's Secret Weapon

In the heart of British Naval Intelligence, a secret organization known as Room 40 became one of history's most successful cryptanalysis operations:

- Intercepted and decrypted German naval codes
- Decoded the infamous Zimmermann Telegram
- Influenced America's entry into WWI
- Established modern signals intelligence

### The ADFGVX Cipher

One of WWI's most sophisticated encryption systems, the ADFGVX cipher combined substitution and transposition:

#### How it Worked:
1. Used a 6x6 grid filled with letters and numbers
2. Substituted letters with pairs of ADFGVX symbols
3. Applied columnar transposition
4. Created highly secure messages for German forces

Example ADFGVX Grid:
```text
 A D F G V X
A B 2 3 4 1 8
D L A T W O M
F C I E R Y Q
G K U S V P N
V Z X H B D G
X 5 6 7 9 0 F
The Russian Collapse
Poor cryptographic practices contributed to Russian military failures:

Use of simple substitution ciphers
Sending messages in clear text
Lack of secure communication protocols
Vulnerable to German intelligence

World War II (1939-1945)
