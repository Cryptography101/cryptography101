### TPM Operations
```python
# Python example using TPM2-TSS
from tpm2_pytss import *

# Initialize TPM context
context = ESAPI()

# Generate random numbers
random_bytes = context.get_random(32)

# Create primary key
primary_key = context.create_primary(
    TPM2_RH_OWNER,
    TPM2B_SENSITIVE_CREATE(),
    TPM2B_PUBLIC(
        TPM2_ALG_RSA,
